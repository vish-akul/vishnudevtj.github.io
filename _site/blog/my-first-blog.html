<h1 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h1>
<p>Jekyll is site generator . we will give a template and them the data and jekyll will process this and make a html by putting required data in the template the adwantage of jekyll is that it is a static webpage ie , no server side processing is required when the user request the webpage the pre-generated page is served rather than the dynamic creating of webpage at users request . The posts are written in markdown language and liquid templating engine is used by jekyll.</p>
<h1 id="hosting">Hosting</h1>
<p>This can be hosted with just Apache or Nginix server and the best part is we could host our jekyll site in github which make it more aawsome this is page is hosted under github .</p>
<h1 id="requirement">Requirement</h1>
<p>Jekyll only require Ruby to to work and setting up in linux was very simple after installing ruby just gem install jekyll .</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
